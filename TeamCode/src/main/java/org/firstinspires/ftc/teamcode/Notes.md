Welcome! This is the EngiNERDs team 9892 Code for this years game CenterStage (2023-2024)

Things to NOTE

The Code in this Repository, will be updated throughout the season

Feel free to look at FTC templates in (FtcRobotController -> Java -> org.fistinspires.ftc.robotcontroller -> external.samples) to find some useful code to look at.

Assuming that you are using this code as a reference, there are some good videos on the EngiNERDs youtube channel if you are confused about any concepts, or just understanding what the code is trying to do.

Some other Major channels / Videos / Manuals to look at, are
